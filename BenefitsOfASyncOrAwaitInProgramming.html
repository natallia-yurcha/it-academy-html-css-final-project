        <p>Whenever I’m TA for a introductory CS class where students learn some programming language, I have trouble
            coming up with good exercises. Problems from Project Euler and the like are usually much too difficult for
            beginners, especially if they don’t have a strong background in mathematics.</p>
        <p>This page is a collection of progressively more difficult exercises that are suitable for people who just
            started learning. It will be extended as I come up with new exercises. Except for the GUI questions,
            exercises are generally algorithmic and should be solvable without learning any libraries. The difficulty of
            the exercises of course somewhat depends on the programming language you use. The List exercises for example
            are more complicated in languages like C that don’t have build-in support for lists.</p>

        <p>Learning to program means learning how to solve problems using code. Conceptually it is not very difficult to
            write a program that solves a problem that you can solve yourself. The skill you need to acquire is thinking
            very precisely about how you solve the problem and breaking it down into steps that are so simple that a
            computer can execute them. I encourage you to first solve a few instances of a problem by hand and think
            about what you did to find the solution. For example if the task is sorting lists, sort some short lists
            yourself.</p>
        <p>A reasonable method would be to find the smallest element, write it down and cross it out of the original
            list and repeat this process until you have sorted the whole list. Then you have to teach the computer 1)
            how to find the smallest element, 2) how to write it down, 3) how to cross it out, and wrap this in a loop.
            Then continue this task breakdown process until you’re confident you know how to write the necessary
            program.</p>

        <h4>Benefits Of ASync/Await In Programming</h4>
        <p>To make good progress in your programming task, you need to test your work as early and as thoroughly as
            possible. Everybody makes mistakes while programming and finding mistakes in programs consumes a very large
            part of a programmer’s work-day. Finding a problem in a small and easy piece of code is much simpler than
            trying to spot it in a large program.</p>
